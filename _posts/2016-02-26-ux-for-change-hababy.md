## What is the Hababy App?
Hababy is a play on words between the Arabic word for “sweetheart” and the English word “baby”. The project aims to build an app for pregnant refugees fleeing to countries. Countries where they have no contacts, limited language skills and no access to medical help.

The idea, born from a hackathon created the group [EmpowerHack]. The group uses technology to empower women on a global scale, connecting refugees to doctors, or providing a platform where they can share their stories anonymously.

## What challenges are we facing?

### Cultural Challenges
There’s no doubt that cultures can differ on a huge scale. When your knowledge is quite limited on a country in war, the differences suddenly feel amplified. The crisis is on a huge scale and trying to cater for the majority and then prioritise is a whole other challenge. What education have they had? Which technologies do they have access to? Does this mean they are tech savvy? We've heard that pregnancy is quite common among refugees for many reasons, does this mean it’s still taboo? Does this mean confidentiality when sharing the app is crucial?

> “Despite up to 80% of world’s refugees being women and children, the problems faced by them are never at the forefront. EmpowerHack was born to change just that by taking collaborative design to scale. Female refugees are among the most vulnerable, facing sexual violence, coercion, forced and early marriage, social isolation, and a lack of access to gender-specific health care and education.”

### Cross-Cultural Challenges
The first hand experience I had of the cultural changes we were facing were when personas came up. As soon as we sat around the table it went a little bit like this: 

> “Ok so the app is aimed at pregnant refugees so our persona is going to be a woman”

> “So let’s name her Sima, she is 19 years old and obviously pregnant”

**Then came the question of her marital status.**

> "No, she can't be married at 19!"

People then quickly said absolutely not because she was nineteen and too young. Then someone asked how else could she be pregnant. The other answer which we knew was a likely possibility was worse. It became apparent that our own taboos were being taken into consideration when designing for another culture. Suddenly idea of this refugee the whole backstory was being romanticised. The answers that soon came after meant she was middle class, well educated and could read English. 

It's hard to design for a completely different culture and to realise your own bias is playing too much of a part.

### UX Challenges
How do you create an app empathising with people when you so desperately want to sympathise with them? I have no genuine first hand knowledge of refugees. My assumption is that they’re far more concerned with things bigger than an application; even if the aim is to help them.

As with other professions where dealing with emotions, you need to self protect a little bit. Working full time and volunteering on many projects is tiring, even when it’s worth it. Working on an emotional project as well is more mentally draining and learning to switch off is just as important as switching on. The one thing I don’t like about the acronym is that “user” is impersonal. This is echoed when we Google for a persona image and stick in a random stock photo that we have no emotional attachment to. The right balance is definitely a working progress. We need to build more than enough empathy with refugees and develop a thick enough skin to be able to carry on the project.

The second issue is that this project is volunteering based, and it’s one which desperately needs to be done properly. Of course, as UX-ers we know that comes from speaking to users. My fear is that our users have much bigger things to worry about than speaking to 'privileged' people about an app they “promise” will help them. We’re dealing with a whole new level of empathy, trust building and emotional needs.

One amazing way we are overcoming this problem is by having people on the ground to do hands on research. People who work and volunteer more of their time with the doctors and volunteers.

## What does the project need help with
The Hababy project is still in the early stages with making great progress with the number of dedicated volunteers. What the project needs is outreach. We have an amazing story to share and this project can’t go ahead without people. The project really does highlight a range of issues, from women’s issues to pregnancy, medical and the refugee crisis. 

We want to share stories from refugees, really highlighting their journeys, and the humanitarian crisis that it is. Unfortunately most media limits the story they portray depending on how they think the public is swaying. The refugee crisis is not black and white, and neither are their stories. Our project really aims to show the work that needs to be done from a lower level hands on approach. 

Hababy also needs volunteers! Whether be that in user experience, public relations or development. There are more than a few challenges to overcome and not ones we can combat alone. Every issue we face is nowhere near a reflection of what our users are facing. Every step we take to help them will be worth it.
