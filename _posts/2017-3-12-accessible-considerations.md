## Fonts and text

+ Select basic, simple, easily-readable fonts.
+ Use a limited number of fonts.
+ Ensure sufficient contrast between the text and the background.
+ Avoid small font sizes.
+ Use relative units for font size.
+ Limit the use of font variations such as bold, italics, and ALL CAPITAL LETTERS.
+ Don't rely only on the appearance of the font (color, shape, font variation, placement, etc.) to convey meaning.
+ Avoid blinking or moving text.

## Images

+ Use real text rather than text within graphics.
+ Avoid placing differently coloured images underneath text (e.g. using a black image and a white image in a carousel behind the same coloured text)

## Alt text

+ Be accurate and equivalent in presenting the same content and function of the image.
+ Be succinct. This means the correct content (if there is content) and function (if there is a function) of the image should be presented as succinctly as is appropriate. Typically no more than a few words are necessary, though rarely a short sentence or two may be appropriate.
+ NOT be redundant or provide the same information as text within the context of the image.
+ NOT use the phrases "image of ..." or "graphic of ..." to describe the image. It usually apparent to the user that it is an image. And if the image is conveying content, it is typically not necessary that the user know that it is an image that is conveying the content, as opposed to text. If the fact that an image is a photograph or illustration, etc. is important content, it may be useful to include this in alternative text.

## Link text

Ensure that the link text makes sense on its own - Avoid "Click Here" in link text. Other ambiguous links, such as "More" or "Continue", can also be confusing.
