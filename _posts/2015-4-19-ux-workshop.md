title: CodeFirst:Girls UX Workshop
description: CodeFirst:Girls is a new organisation aiming to get women into technology, which is more than just about coding! Here are my thoughts and my journey from running a one-day course with hands-on exercises around User Experience.

## Who am I?
I am Elizabeth Chesters from Thought Works, a Social and Economic (Pillar 3) champion of education for Manchester. I have been teaching Ruby alongside Pablo Porto Veloso and Matt Chamberlain on behalf of CodeFirst:Girls, and alongside Darren Haken and Alina Balusescu in our day at Westholme High School. Last Sunday, myself, Daniel Yates and Ama Asare ran a workshop teaching 9 girls the basics of user experience and how to go about designing their app idea for an actual person. 
 
## Who are CodeFirst:Girls?
CodeFirst:Girls are an organisation aimed at getting women involved in technology; whether that's through teaching them how to code or putting them in touch with someone with the right skillset to build their entrepreneurial idea. They are a young organisation and we as ThoughtWorks have been working with them from both of our London and Manchester offices.

## What did we do?
Three volunteers, including myself ran a full day workshop, offering an insight with hands-on exercises as to what UX involves. We explained why UX is needed, and not a "dreaded" buzz word

## What did we cover?
Alongside Hannah Fitzgerald-Kearns, we designed a UX workshop structure that we could take anywhere as an absolute basic on how to approach the topic in your project.

1. PERSONAS:
    - Why are personas part of UX?
    - How do we create personas - what's the level of detail that we need?
    - How does someone's characteristics or tendencies affect our app and design?
2. EMPATHY MAPPING:
    - How do we build a connection with this person that we've created?
    - What situations are our persona going to be in when they want our app?
    - What issues are they facing? Looking after children; juggling a basket and shopping at the same time?
3. USER JOURNEYS:
     - What's going to make our persona open our app?
     - What goals are they wanting to achieve?
     - How many steps and which steps does someone take to achieve a goal?
4. PROTOTYPE:
     - What are the different ways we can do prototypes?
     - What detail do we include in our paper prototypes?
     - Why are they useful and what do we want out of doing a prototype?
5. USER TESTING:
     - Questionnaires and Tasks
     - What do we want out of user testing? What do we achieve from speaking to users?
     - What questions do we ask users?
     - How do we go about conducting user testing with set tasks?
6. PRESENTATIONS:
     - What have we learnt today from the workshop and how do we take this forward when designing our applications?
    
## What did I learn from it?
Every teaching situation has been so different so far and this workshop was no exception. We had a bit of friction on one team which left most of the facilitators wondering when and how to step in. Again, groups went at different speeds and it was sometimes hard to balance the pace of the room. From this workshop in particular I've learnt some much about I assume. The more I'm passionate about something, the more I find it easier - which in turn means I assume that everyone just magically gets what I'm trying to say. I learnt that the cheatsheet I had put on everyone's desk made life a lot easier. It gave people something to scribble notes on, it meant if I had forgotten to say something out of nerves that I had already given someone the answer on a sheet. I didn't plan on relying on the sheets as much I did, but it was nice even at the beginning that people got stuck in while we were waiting for people to arrive and started to read my sheets!
I also learnt that as part of this structure people needed time to actually plan an app idea. This made the day so much more productive because it then became an idea that was feasible to take forward. Either way despite a few mishaps and it being a first time workshop for a dev, it went really well! Twitter was full of feedback, we got the work done, and we even have a mini-competition, courtesy of Carla Parr. Project permitted of being sent to London, we have been asked to run the course again for CodeFirst:Girls!
