title: Winning Hack Manchester
description: My journey from a hackathon to an internship with ThoughtWorks.
---

I’ve been to three hackathons now, with StudentHack being my fourth next month.

Hack Manchester was great. The onesies, the food, the friends I made last year, the 25 hours of turning Manchester’s streets into a Mario Kart track. I was also lucky enough to have been invited to work with one of the ThoughtWorks teams.

We decided to do the Web Apps challenge, involving a travel themed game, so we turned Manchester’s streets into a Mario Kart track. What amazed me was just how devoted my team members were. I would never have pictured learning about Jasmine, or doing any unit tests at a hackathon. Not because I don’t want to do the work properly but you never imagine yourself having the time to build a system and have tests for it. Unfortunately our back-end didn’t go to plan as quickly as we’d hoped, which resulted in having a (slightly) working prototype 12 minutes before submission. At this point, we were all so tired our beds back at home were calling us from afar. On a good note though, the user could choose from a range of avatars, before they started to drift around our track in all sorts of directions.

In the end we chose to not submit, but we gave it our best shot. We had all learnt something new, whether that be Node JS, Jasmine, or a new JavaScript technique. A few Thursdays after the hackathon I got an email saying ThoughtWorks had a new proposition for me, and they would give me a ring, tomorrow. Tomorrow. That was one of the worst 24 hours I had to endure. What sort of proposition was it, especially since I had just miserable failed my interview and it was “exciting” according to the email.

I got an internship! Despite all of the stuff ups I made in my interview process, the fact that we didn’t really get our submission to work and that we didn’t even submit anything in the end anyway. None of it mattered. They said my team liked what I did, and that I would be working with ThoughtWorks full time for a month for the chance to earn a place on their graduate scheme.

So without even submitting anything, I won. I’m one of the top winners of Hack Manchester. Here’s to March 3rd, when I start my internship.
