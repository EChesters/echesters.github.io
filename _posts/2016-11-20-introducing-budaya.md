title: What changes across cultures - The Budaya Series 
description: The budaya series is articles exploring what consistently changes across cultures and how this impacts our UX. Here, we take a look at a high level list of just what aspects of a culture need to be considered when you localise your user experiences

## What is Budaya?

Budaya means ‘culture’ in Indonesian, and is my personal project as a UX researcher. The series is a template of what to consider when taking your brand across cultures. With real world examples, we explore the differences from all around the globe, and their importance for your product. While not all these things may differ for you personally, these should always be looked into in when designing for a different culture to your own.

## So what changes?

This post is a brief outline of what can change, how it impacts UX and why each aspect matters. So much of the UX changes per person, per culture and per ability. Here is an outline of what to consider:

* [Language]
* Aesthetics
* Data
* Behaviours
* Psychology
* Environment
* Hardware
* People
* Internal differences
* Gert Hofstede’s 6 Cultural Dimensions
    * Individualism versus Collectivism
    * Power Distance
    * Indulgence versus Restraint
    * Femininity versus Masculinity
    * Long-term versus Short-term Orientation

### Language

The first aspect to look into is changing the language. Does your new target audience have different official languages? Are there terms and conditions as part of your service, which users need to understand? Language is how we understand everything. All that we read, we hear and how we communicate and express ourselves is through language. While translating can be expensive, the value from doing so is incomparable. Not only are the words translated, but so is context and metaphors. 

When you change language, it also may mean that the direction of the text may differ. This means that the design and layout also moves. Menus, navigation, primary buttons; these all flip over to the other side.

</figure>

<span class="emphasise">Did you know: while Arabic reads from right to left, their numbers are read left to right.</span>

Your UI will also need to be flexible, as some words may now be longer or shorter. Languages like Norwegian and German are particularly known to have longer words (in comparison to English).

### Aesthetics

When it comes to culture, language is not that only thing which needs translating. Icons, colours, fonts and even animals have their own meanings which change. 

#### Icons

Metaphors are forever changing, even within a culture. Take the floppy disk icon as an example, when it represents saving. This icon not only is archaic in Western culture, it’s also not a guarantee that the other culture even had floppy disks when they were popular.

#### Colours

Not only does the meaning of a colour change, but the same colour may mean the complete opposite in different countries. Take white as an example. In the Western world, it’s the predominant colour on a lot of websites. It’s clean, it’s pure, it’s neutral. Yet where it means life in Western culture, it also means death in places like Mexico. Colours have a huge impact on how we perceive things and how we feel. 

#### Fonts

Typography again is a huge part of aesthetics, and again is another aspect which changes. Fonts have meaning. Some have their own cultures, positive or negative, like Comic Sans. Others are famous through their uses in particular cultural industries.

<span class="emphasise">Did you know: The ITC Souvenir font was used in British 1970s porn films.</span>

<span class="emphasise">The [Trajan font is a renowned font used in film posters and has a YouTube video] dedicated to this.</span>

#### Animals

Attitudes towards animals in certain cultures can impact more of the UX than at first thought. For example, it’s well known that Indians treat cows with the utmost respect. Religious cultures like Judaism and Islam also consider pigs to be dirty. But how does this affect UX? Well, if you have an animal in your logo, it affects how people perceive your business and your app. 

Take Deliveroo as an example, a food delivery service who have a kangaroo in their logo. As part of their cultural research, they discovered people’s opinions and interpretations. In Paris, France participants thought the logo was a rat. In other countries, they considered the kangaroo to be dirty. This meant it was one of the last animals they wanted to associate with a food service. 

<span class="emphasise">Did you know: even the ‘noise’ an animal makes is different depending on the language.</span>

### Data
Data is one of the biggest and most important aspects in a culture which affects our user experiences. Without catering for different circumstances and validation, how will users fill out the forms that we've spent so much time on? 

#### Names

<span class="sidenote">“Remember that a person’s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language” - Dale Carnegie</span>

Names are so important, not only to someone, but to us as designers, markets and UX-ers, to build a relationship with our users and customers. But there can be more than a few complications when building to cater for different names. In Southern India, it’s common to not have a last name or surname. In China, their family name is their first name, and comes before their forename. Romanians for official circumstances like school exams, present their surname first, before their given name.

#### Addresses

In places like the UK, we have an amazing infrastructure when it comes to addresses. So mail and online shopping is a doozy because delivery is reliable (courier depending). Yet, not every country has the same foundations or need for such a service. The UAE for example, does not have postcodes, zip codes or an equivalent. Additionally, they have a building called Burj Khalifa, a boulevard called Burj Khalifa, a lake with the name Burj Khalifa, and a metro station named Burj Khalifa. With no postcodes, a culture using landmarks to navigate, and buildings with 163 floors; delivery apps need to be accommodating.

#### Navigation

If you gave directions to someone asking for the nearest McDonald’s, how would you describe the route? Would you describe which streets to take and turn at, or would the focus be on which landmarks are on the way? How addresses change in a culture, also has an impact on how people navigate around. Take Google Maps for example. In countries where there are no street names (like Japan), they rely on landmarks in order to provide directions. In addition, while places may have street names, that doesn't mean locals know the names or use them, like [Beirut]. 

#### Times and calendars

Timezones are the bane of a developer’s life because of their complexity. Well the complexity doesn’t just stop at timezones. Some countries work on completely different calendars. This means dates, months, and even weekends aren't the same as those using the Gregorian calendar. It was only until recently that Saudi Arabia, officially used the lunar calendar. October 2016, the country switched to the ‘Western’ Gregorian calendar, in an attempt to save money on wages. 

<span class="emphasise">Did you know: It’s been reported that calendars vary so much in a country, that people don’t know what the date is.</span>

<span class="sidenote">"Life in Libya was so unpredictable that people weren't even sure what year it was.” - [Neil MacFarquar], an American reporter</span>

From this, it’s not uncommon for your users to not know important dates like their birthday. 

## To summarise

These are just three aspects which change when localising your app. Watch out for more posts, exploring in detail more of what changes, and how to accommodate for these differences!
