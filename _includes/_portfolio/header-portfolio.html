      <p>I am a UX researcher in London. When I'm not pestering users, you'll find me coding. People are at the heart of what I do, so I work closely with them to discover their stories and issues with technology.</p>
      <p>Specialising in localisation, I've set out to discover how technology can have the biggest impact around the world.</p>
