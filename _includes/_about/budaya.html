      <h2>Localisation</h2>
      <p>In my spare time I study all of the things in user experience that consistently change across cultures. I am crafting a template for all international researchers, to help for localising projects, called the Budaya Series. Its aim is to help developers and designers alike, with design examples and code snippets how to build systems to cater for a global audience.</p>
