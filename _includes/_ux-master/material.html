    <p class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-9 position central">From coming up with your own app idea, creating your target user, protoyping and then testing it with a user! Each section goes through what the technique is, the why and how. Then you get your hands dirty applying the technique!</p>

      <h3>1. About UX</h3>
      <p>Starting from the beginning, we dive into what UX is and what it is not. We touch on how the discipline overlaps with psychology, design, research and development</p>

      <h3>2. Personas</h3>
      <p>We create personas, to understand who we're building the app for. Understand their background and demographics, building empathy for our user</p>

      <h3>3. Empathy Maps</h3>
      <p>Immerse yourself into the situation of our persona, we create an empathy map. Looking at where our user is on the app, what they're hearing, seeing and feeling at the time</p>

      <h3>4. User Journeys</h3>
      <p>Taking a situation from the empathy map, we create a user journey timeline. Here we work out how our persona would achieve one of their goals using our app</p>

    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-6">
      <h3>5. Prototyping</h3>
      <p>Moving onto prototyping! We turn our user journey timelines into a sketch. Using the POP app we turn the sketches into a prototype on our phones, ready for testing</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-10 col-md-6">
      <h3>6. User Testing</h3>
      <p>Now it's time to test our idea with a human! Rotating groups, you have the opportunity to interview and observe someone using your brand new app idea, and come face to face with a user</p>
