  <p>On our first design day we created our elevator pitch to put on our websites and approach charities. I asked everyone to chip in with key phrases on how we could sell the product. I researched the points that a good elevator pitch addresses, and asked my team members to answer them with stickies. The outcome of this was a huge word cloud of stickies that we could use to reinforce our design decisions throughout the day and then build a full paragraph to use after the day.</p>

  <p>At the end of the day I ran a retro on any questions or concerns we had around volunteering in general, that we wanted to address going forward. I also wanted to end the day on a positive and more relaxed note, going through the positives of the design day and the team as a whole. To also reinforce team morale, I organised a mini photoshoot of all the team, giving them professional (serious and fun) headshots they can use to promote themselves and ourselves as a whole. Even my team members who were not as confident, got really into the shoot and here are some of the images below.</p>
