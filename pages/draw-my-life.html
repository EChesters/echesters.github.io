  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3 class="remove-margin top">Designing for refugees</h3>
  <p>Creating anything which is aimed at refugees is quite hard to balance. On the one hand, refugees are vulnerable and need a lot of help and support. On the other, being a refugee is classed as a failure. They don't want to be a refugee, they don't want anything associated with being a refugee.</p>

  <h3>Remote Testing</h3>
  <p>We ran numerous user testing sessions remotely with camp workers in Serbia. In collaboration with my team, I did the discussion guide, and the moderation of the session over Skype. We used Quicktime and a phone to record the sessions, as well as ensuring HotJar was installed for additional recording and data.</p>

  <h3>Analytics</h3>
  <p>For Draw My Life, I added both Google Analytics and HotJar to the website.</p>

  <p>Not only is HotJar useful for statistics, heat maps and surveys, but it also helps with testing. By being able to see what our users see on their devices, enables us to view our site on a much wider range of screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
