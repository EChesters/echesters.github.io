  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an online platform for field workers in refugee camps to showcase the effects of the crisis with children's drawings</li>
    <li>Display the pictures to members of public to demonstrate the crisis and gain support for helping refugees</li>
    <li>Provide a game like element for children to interact with the app with their drawings</li>
    <li>Create a website to showcase the team and project</li>
    <!-- Add a link to the website case study page once done -->
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3 class="remove-margin top">Designing for refugees</h3>
  <p>Creating anything which is aimed at refugees is quite hard to balance. On the one hand, refugees are vulnerable and need a lot of help and support. On the other, being a refugee is classed as a failure. They don't want to be a refugee, they don't want anything associated with being a refugee.</p>
  <p>In order to gage just who the refugees we are targeting were, <a href="/2016/04/11/volunteering-in-calais.html">I volunteered in the camps at Calais and Dunkirk for a week</a>.</p>

  <h3>Anoymity</h3>
  <p>To truly help refugees, comes from an understanding in their situation, not just on an empathetic level but from a legal point. We wanted to ensure we didn't do anything which could hurt someone's claim of asylum inside Europe. I came to understand a lot of the lega repurcussions we could have by doing this project <a href="/2016/04/17/volunteering-in-calais-after.html">when I volunteered in Calais</a>. Not only do a lot of refugees not fully understand asylum laws, we were targeting children, who are more vulnerable and where this should never be a concern for them.</p>

  <p>The challenges that we face include, children wanting to name their drawings. This causes an issue as our drawings could clearly depict where a child and thus their parents have been prior to claiming asylum.</p>

  <p>Due to the sensitive nature of our target audience, we can't risk any inappropriate images being uploaded.</p>

  <h3>Balancing personas</h3>
  <p>Our first priority were the field workers in refugee camps across Europe. Without focusing on field workers, we would have no data input to offer our secondary personas like campaigners and journalists. When we decided on which services we could offer each persona, like our website and API, we found the patterns between them and explored the approach given the found overlap between persona needs.</p>

  <h2>My Project Responsibilities</h2>
  <h3 class="remove-margin top">Design Workshop</h3>
  <p>In between meeting up to do project work, I also ran our design sprint day. This involved facilitating the discussion throughout the day, prepping for the goals and outcomes of the day and ensuring we achieved those. I ran interactive activities for the whole team, to enable every person had their say.</p>

  <h3>Wireframes</h3>
  <p>For this project, for every task that required wireframes and designs, I mocked did research and mocked up how the screens should look. I also had the opportunity to work with a graphic designer, to gather feedback and bounce ideas around with. As the </p>

  <h3>Remote Testing</h3>
  <p>We ran numerous user testing sessions remotely with camp workers in Serbia. In collaboration with my team, I did the discussion guide, and the moderation of the session over Skype. We used Quicktime and a phone to record the sessions, as well as ensuring HotJar was installed for additional recording and data.</p>

  <h3>Analytics</h3>
  <p>For Draw My Life, I added both Google Analytics and HotJar to the website.</p>

  <p>Not only is HotJar useful for statistics, heat maps and surveys, but it also helps with testing. By being able to see what our users see on their devices, enables us to view our site on a much wider range of screen sizes and resolutions.</p>

  <p>Having only run one pilot session so far, we haven't been able to get much from the analytics. This will be an on-going thing, which I also plan to use for A/B testing, and prioritise monitoring the quantitative data later on down the line.</p>

  <h3>Next challenges</h3>
  <p>The next project I'm leading on for Draw My Life is our project and team showcasing website. This will be aimed at people like campaigners and journalists, demonstrating how a subset of our data look, how the data can be used and how to access our data.</p>
