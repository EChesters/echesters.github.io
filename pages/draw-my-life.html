  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Create an online platform for field workers in refugee camps to showcase the affects of the crisis with children's drawings</li>
    <li>Display the pictures to members of public to demonstrate the crisis and gain support for helping refugees</li>
    <li>Provide a game like element for children to interact with the app with their drawings</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3 class="remove-margin top">Designing for refugees</h3>
  <p>Creating anything which is aimed at refugees is quite hard to balance. On the one hand, refugees are vulnerable and need a lot of help and support. On the other, being a refugee is classed as a failure. They don't want to be a refugee, they don't want anything associated with being a refugee.</p>
  <p>In order to gage just who the refugees we are targeting were, <a href="/2016/04/11/volunteering-in-calais.html">I volunteered in the camps at Calais and Dunkirk for a week</a>.</p>

  <h3>Anoymity</h3>
  <p>To truly help refugees, comes from an understanding in their situation, not just on an empathetic level but from a legal point. We wanted to ensure we didn't do anything which could hurt someone's claim of asylum inside Europe. I came to understand a lot of the lega repurcussions we could have by doing this project <a href="/2016/04/17/volunteering-in-calais-after.html">when I volunteered in Calais</a>. Not only do a lot of refugees not fully understand asylum laws, we were targeting children, who are more vulnerable and where this should never be a concern for them.</p>

  <p>The challenges that we face include, children wanting to name their drawings. This causes an issue as our drawings could clearly depict where a child and thus their parents have been prior to claiming asylum.</p>

  <p>Due to the sensitive nature of our target audience, we can't not risk any images being uploaded, which were of an inappropriate nature.</p>

  <h3>Wireframes</h3>
  <p>For this project, for every task that required wireframes and designs, I mocked did research and mocked up how the screens should look. I also had the opportunity to work with a graphic designer, to gather feedback and bounce ideas around with. As the </p>

  <h3>Remote Testing</h3>
  <p>We ran numerous user testing sessions remotely with camp workers in Serbia. In collaboration with my team, I did the discussion guide, and the moderation of the session over Skype. We used Quicktime and a phone to record the sessions, as well as ensuring HotJar was installed for additional recording and data.</p>

  <h3>Analytics</h3>
  <p>For Draw My Life, I added both Google Analytics and HotJar to the website.</p>

  <p>Not only is HotJar useful for statistics, heat maps and surveys, but it also helps with testing. By being able to see what our users see on their devices, enables us to view our site on a much wider range of screen sizes and resolutions.</p>
