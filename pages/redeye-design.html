	<p>Most projects are split into two types, research and design. Here are the design processes and methodologies I use for a range of my clients.</p>
	<p>Unfortunately most clients are under NDA and cannot be shared online in this portfolio. However industries include, travel, retail, vehicle, with the list growing every day!</p>

	<h2>UX design techniques</h2>
	<p>RedEye offer a range of UX design services. On my team I am responsible for the following are the services which I do on a regular basis.</p>

	<h3>Domestic and international desk research</h3>
	<p>No design is complete without research. For design projects, I am often able to use insights from our usability testing sessions. Even if we don't have testing for one client, we often videos from similar clients. Often users will also tell you about their experiences with competitors, and we use their quotes to demonstrate issues our users are having.</p>

	<p>I ensure to keep my clients ahead of the game from an international stand point, so I actively check global competitors. It's englightening to see the other issues that other cultures are facing and how they're solving the same issues as our users. This takes longer than usual, as often I will research with unpersonalised search engines and in multiple languages. However the ideas and inspiration from looking further afield are incomparable. I have also written a business insight post targeting clients to specifically take notice of international companies.</p>

	<h3>Competitor analysis</h3>
	<p>I often conduct a lot of competitor analysis, not only for ideas but also to ensure my recommendations are keeping my clients ahead of the game.</p>

	<h3>Competitor monitoring</h3>
	<p>Competitor analysis is not that valuable if conducted only once. I designed an internal folder structure system where we date every competitor analysis we conduct, so we can monitor how our competitors are changing over the course of roughly every 3 months. We take notice of what areas of the site ae changing, which pages they've focused on, and then use these in order to judge if there's something we've missed for our clients.</p>

	<h3>Sketching</h3>
	<p>Our clients have deadlines and we bill by the hour. Cheap and fast wireframing and designs are crucial for gathering feedback and getting the job done right, from the beginning. With my love for stationary I often do sketches, brainstorming flows on whiteboards and cover everything in sticky notes.</p>

	<p>For an even cheaper sketch, I use the technique which I popularised on <a href="/pages/a-world-at-school.html">A World At School</a> and at Ladies that UX workshops. <a href="/2015/11/30/interactive-prototyping-sticky-notes.html">I even blogged about prototyping with sticky notes</a>, which received great feedback on Twitter and the Slack UX community.</p>

	<h3>User flows and journeys</h3>
	<p>Not only do we design singular pages, often we are challenged with restructuring whole user journeys, especially for checkout journeys. For every restructure I do, I ensure to come up with different options for the client. This is so I can prioritise the usability challenges differently in the options, and I can offer AB testing. I appreciate every recommendation I do is simply a hypothesis until it has been tested using both quantitative and qualitive methods.</p>

	<h3>Wireframing and interactive prototyping</h3>
	<p>Usually the end step for recommendations are building the wireframes. For a rough first draft I will take sketches and turn them into wireframes using Axure. When presenting multiple options and states I can also use Axure to build in interactivity. Quite often we will also test with Axure prototypes which work really well to test business concepts and acquire a rough feel for what the user expects.</p>
	<p>The wireframes are also great for communicating with different teams. I use these to communicate with client developers what needs to be built and how, along with our designers on how to skin the wireframe whilst ensuring we maintain all usability.</p>

	<h3>Expert reviews</h3>
	<p>For smaller budget projects I write up an expert review, ensuring client websites are keeping inline with basic UX principles. Using a quality analyst mindset, we also run basic testing over the site, going through the journeys picking apart any aspect of the site which we have seen cause issues in testing. At the end we compile a list of issues, reasoning and a variety of recommendations on how to solve each problem. We always recommend testing, but we use this as an introduction to demonstrate to clients that their websites are not flawless.</p>
