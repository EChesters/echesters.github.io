    <p class="summary">Throughout my life I have always taught others. From paired reading in primary and high school, to formally teaching coding on behalf of organisations. I have taught most ages, as young as 10, to teenagers, university students, and professionals. If you're interested in getting involved, why not <a href="//twitter.com/EChesters">tweet me</a>!</p>

      <h3>Coding London</h3>
      <p>In September 2015 I co-founder the UK's first official Codecademy meet-up called Coding London! We were a meet-up guiding people not only through the Codecademy material, but offering help on how to use the languages on their own machines, rather than a provided platform. We also wanted to provide a physical community for a tool which is globally recognised. I ran the beginner web development courses, alongside my own Git tutorial.</p>

      <h3>Westholme High School</h3>
      <p>Whilst at ThoughtWorks, I was the champion of education inthe Manchester office. As part of the company's social impact within the community, I was responsible for teaching and running educational classes. We were invited to teach at <a href="//www.westholmeschool.com/">Westholme School</a>, an independent day school in Blackburn. </p>
      <p>We ran a whole school day workshop which offered taster sessions in 3 areas of technology. The aim was to inspire students to consider a role in technology, but know that there was more to the industry than programming. We ran sessions on what it meant to be a business analyst, a developer and a quality analyst.</p>

The workshops I have been a part of is Coder Dojo, Build your own Arduino and Hammersmith's Health and Fitness Hackathon. The idea behind STEMNet Ambassadors is to promote all things STEM and really encourage from an early age to choose these subjects as qualifications, such as GCSEs and ALevels.</p>
