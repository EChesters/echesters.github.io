      <h2 class="add-margin top">CodeFirst:Girls</h2>
      <p>For two years I have volunteered teaching for <a href="//codefirstgirls.org.uk">CodeFirst:Girls</a>. I started teaching their Ruby course at Manchester University and then continued to teach in London. To date I have taught their Beginners HTML, CSS and JavaScript; Summer Intensive with Python; Bootcamp; and Ruby courses. I have also planned and ran <a href="/2015/04/19/ux-workshop.html">my own UX Masterclass</a> twice, in both Manchester and London, which received amazing feedback with an average rating of 4 out of 5.</p>

      <h2>23 Code Street</h2>
      <p>Throughout Summer 2016, I have been teaching and assisting <a href="//23codestreet.com">23 Code Street</a>. A course with the social impact, teaching students in London, with all proceeds going to instructors going to India to teach under privileged women. This is a crash course in web development using HTMl, CSS, JavaScript and Node. We also collaborate with other experts in the field, like NodeGirls and UsTwo. </p>

      <h2>Django Girls Milton Keynes</h2>
      <p>I was invited to speak and volunteer for Django Girls in Milton Keynes. I taught students an introduction to Python and how to build a website with Django. I also gave a presentation on what to do next if they wanted to be developer, and what other tech roles there were if they didn't like programming.</p>

      <h2>Rails Girls London</h2>
      <p>For 2 days I volunteered at Rails Girls London, at Microsoft's Skype offices in Chancery Lane. The aim, inspiring women to take up web development with Ruby on Rails. What was amazing, was the students I mentored that day were all from my CodeFirst:Girls class in London!</p>

      <h2>Coding London</h2>
      <p>In September 2015 I co-founder the UK's first official Codecademy meet-up called Coding London! We were a meet-up guiding people not only through the Codecademy material, but offering help on how to use the languages on their own machines, rather than a provided platform. We also wanted to provide a physical community for a tool which is globally recognised. I ran the beginner web development courses, alongside my own Git tutorial.</p>

      <h2>Acorn Inspirations</h2>
      <p>I was a mentor and photographer at the AcornHack in 2015. The 2 day hackathon was for high school students and aimed to offer them a broad insight into tech. As a mentor I helped build a student's project, with code and UX guidance. I also volunteered for the overall event, doing photography and helping other teams where I could.</p>

      <h2>STEMNet Ambassador</h2>
      <p>i have also been a STEMNet Ambassador for the last 3 years. I have assisted a range of events, my favourite is teen tech! The workshops I have been a part of is Coder Dojo, Build your own Arduino and Hammersmith's Health and Fitness Hackathon. The idea behind STEMNet Ambassadors is to promote all things STEM and really encourage from an early age to choose these subjects as qualifications, such as GCSEs and ALevels.</p>

      <h3>Teen Tech</h3>
      <p>For 2 years in a row, I have volunteered at <a href="//www.teentech.com">Teen Tech</a> in both Manchester and London. Ran by Maggie Philbin, the day inspires secondary school pupils in all areas of STEM subjects, ranging from civil engineering and robots to computer science and mechanics.</p>

      <h2>Westholme High School</h2>
      <p>Whilst at ThoughtWorks, I was the champion of education inthe Manchester office. As part of the company's social impact within the community, I was responsible for teaching and running educational classes. We were invited to teach at <a href="//www.westholmeschool.com/">Westholme School</a>, an independent day school in Blackburn. </p>
      <p>We ran a whole school day workshop which offered taster sessions in 3 areas of technology. The aim was to inspire students to consider a role in technology, but know that there was more to the industry than programming. We ran sessions on what it meant to be a business analyst, a developer and a quality analyst.</p>
