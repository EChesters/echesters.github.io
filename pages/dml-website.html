	<p class="summary">I lead the UX on the Draw My Life website project, from research, to wireframes, and as a hobbyist developer I build the site too. With the website, I aim to showcase our project and team, whilst being the online location of downloading our data.

	<h2>Design Day</h2>
	<p>To kick off the project I ran a design day for the team, ensuring we were all on the same page. I created a schedule to cover important team issues first, like our elevator pitch to ensure consistent communication with charities and organisations. Secondly, I ran an interactive brainstorm for branding, to understand what the team wanted Draw My Life to mean and look like. I also lead the UX tasks, for the Draw My Life data tool and the website, involving user journeys, empathy maps, personas and sketches.</p>

	<h2>User Journey and Site Map</h2>
	<p>Taking the user journey information from the design day, I created a site map of the Draw My Life website. I laid out all the pages needed, each with the content neeed per page and how the pages linked together and where. From this, I could see visually the journeys people could take.</p>

	<h2>Wireframes</h2>
	<p>Using Axure, I created wireframes for each of the pages. Using each bullet point for the page on the site map, I created separate sections, ensuring the flow and story of the page still made sense. I wanted to keep each section as independent as possible, to allow the team to rearrange the flow of the page and the order of the Call To Actions, depending on project KPIs, now and in the future. This is a similar design solution I used for <a href="/pages/a-world-at-school.html">A World At School</a></p>
