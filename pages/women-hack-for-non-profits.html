            <h2>Process</h2>
            <h3>Requirement Gathering</h3>
            <p>I joined the project at the early stages and went through my process of requirement gathering. After many interviews with the co-founders and users it was clear the issues we had with the current website and how the founders wanted the group to be portrayed. It took a lot of phone calls, meetings and user interviews for the requirements.</p>

            <h3>Prototypes</h3>
            <p>I learnt the most from this project in terms of prototypes. I wanted to improve my front-end coding and decided to do all of my prototypes in HTML and CSS. Creating prototypes using Github meant that even as a user experience designer I could also be an advocate for open-source projects, which is a core value of the community. Using Git also gave me reassurance to really take big leaps in my designs, because with versioning control it's easy to switch between different looks and showcase the evolution of my designs.</p>

            &nbsp;
            <p>I quickly learnt to temper the types mockups with different people on the projects. Sometimes I would hit issues with presenting a too high level fidelity prototype in HTML, which would often look too much like a finished product. Taking my prototypes back to basics just using sticky notes for organising things like sections and content, lead to a more interactive, collaborative and successful result. Translating the mockups into sketches and only then building a HTML prototype did the project start to pick up pace and at a cheaper rate.</p>

            <p class="sidenote">The interactive prototype can still be found <a href="http://echesters.github.io/WHFNP-Website/index.html">here on my github</a>.</p>

            <h3>Sketching</h3>
            <p>As the project went on, my appreciation for an earlier process started to unfold. I now sketch every page before investing in a higher fidelity mockup. I also started to make the sketching more collaborative with the stakeholders and members of the team. This helped the team make the decisions faster and made people feel like a part of the process in our website.</p>

            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p>I gathered feedback in numerous ways, from Twitter, the WHFNP community and a UX Slack community. I also did user testing with people in the work spaces the team made use of. I set people tasks giving them different characters. For example I would tell a user they're now a non-profit, and set them the task of finding how to contact us about a project.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>Great feedback in user interviews, positive attitude and tasks were completed. Users could find the call to actions.</p>
            <p>Really learnt to appreciate cheaper and quicker prototypes.</p>

          <section>
            <h2>Future Plans</h2>
            <p>User testing with the latest designs once the new website goes live.</p>
            <p>Adding analytics will show us the user journeys people are actually taking and will show us how we need to drive users to where we want them to go.</p>
