summary: My adventures with EmpowerHack have not been with just one project, but across at least three to date. The challenges we have faced have been by far some of the most complicated and fascinating so far. Here I showcase our work and the UX work I've done for the organisation.

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>As part of my journey with EmpowerHack I have been involved in 3 projects.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HaBaby: A medical app to support pregnant refugees in transit. The app will provide a way for women to communicate their symptoms and medical history with doctors.</li>
    <li>HerStory: A platform, serving as an outlet for refugees to share their stories, and improve their mental health through narrative therapy.</li>
    <li>Draw My Life: An online web service, helping refugee children communicate what they have been through, using art therapy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3>Creating experiences for hundreds of cultures</h3>
  <p>One of the biggest challenges throughout the group was that we often referred to refugees las one group of people within a culture. I often felt like we didn't understand what it meant to be a refugee and just how big the differences are between their backgrounds. Despite anyone fleeing their country, being able to be considered a refugee, we decided to target the refugees we could target the most effectively. From this the apps are primarily aimed at refugees in Europe, coming from Africa or the Middle East. In order to gage just who the refugees we are targeting were, <a href="/2016/04/11/volunteering-in-calais.html">I volunteered in the camps at Calais and Dunkirk for a week</a>.</p>
