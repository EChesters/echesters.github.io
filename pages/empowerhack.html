summary: My adventures with EmpowerHack have not been with just one project, but across at least three to date. The challenges we have faced have been by far some of the most complicated and fascinating so far. Here I showcase our work and the UX work I've done for the organisation.

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>As part of my journey with EmpowerHack I have been involved in 3 projects.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>HaBaby: A medical app to support pregnant refugees in transit. The app will provide a way for women to communicate their symptoms and medical history with doctors.</li>
    <li>HerStory: A platform, serving as an outlet for refugees to share their stories, and improve their mental health through narrative therapy.</li>
    <li>Draw My Life: An online web service, helping refugee children communicate what they have been through, using art therapy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3>Creating experiences for hundreds of cultures</h3>
  <p>One of the biggest challenges throughout the group was that we often referred to refugees las one group of people within a culture. I often felt like we didn't understand what it meant to be a refugee and just how big the differences are between their backgrounds. Despite anyone fleeing their country, being able to be considered a refugee, we decided to target the refugees we could target the most effectively. From this the apps are primarily aimed at refugees in Europe, coming from Africa or the Middle East. In order to gage just who the refugees we are targeting were, <a href="/2016/04/11/volunteering-in-calais.html">I volunteered in the camps at Calais and Dunkirk for a week</a>.</p>

  <p>Whilst in Calais I spent quality time with refugees, listening to what they wanted to achieve, why they loved the idea of the UK and gained a lot more insight of our personas. I also got to experience and see the many cultures which were all located in such a small space. The Jungle really demonstrated the optimism and the strength these people have. Whilst sorting clothes, we were often told that while these people are refugees, that's not what they want to consider themselves. They don't need reminding that they're refugees. This made me realise that we were using the term 'refugee' too frequently, and whilst that was our target audience, they didn't need to hear it all of the time. More so when all they're using is an app.</p> 

  <h3>Security and Trust</h3>
  <p>Security has been an important theme throughout Empower Hack. During my time in Calais they told us of all the things that could be used against refugees during their claim. Evidence of the refugee being in any part of Europe prior the UK could seriously harm their claim. So designing apps that specifically aimed at refugees, would be a walking record of their time in other countries during transit. For most of the apps we build, anonymity is a key feature. Whether that be uploading images using EmpowerHack or sharing their story on HerStory.</p>

  <h3>Language and Cultural Barriers</h3>
  <p>Some of the biggest challenges we faced were just how diverse the refugees are in Europe. Even in Calais it was very clear how different the refguees were, by the way they dressed, the technology they had access to and what they were wearing. The refugees who had made their way from the Middle East were often the richest, as they had to be, in order to reach Calais. Paying people smugglers and reaching that far is very expensive. That usually meant the refugees from places like Libya and Syria had some of the latest phones. During some research with field workers, we discovered that people often shared phones. In Calais and Dunkirk this seemed to be less of the case, but unfortunately I don't have the data to know the reasons why everyone in Dunkirk seemed to have their own phone.</p>
  <p>A challenge which we assumed was that data and Internet access in general was a huge problem. However when I asked abou this in Dunkirk it became apparent that obtaining a SIM card was the top priority for every one in transit. This was important, so that they could keep in contact with people they had left behind.</p>

  <h2>Process</h2>
  <h3>Workshops - Personas and Empathy Mapping</h3>
  <p>I was first introduced to the HaBaby project through a UX For Change workshop. The workshop involved a presentation on lean personas, which we then used to create the personas for the project.</p>

  <h3>Hackathon</h3>

  <h3>In-Field Research</h3>
