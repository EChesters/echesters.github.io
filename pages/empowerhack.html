layout: case-study
summary: My adventures with EmpowerHack have not been with just one project, but across at least three to date. Whilst volunteering with people all over the globe, it's quite hard to maintain a strict process. However, the challenges we have faced have been by far some of the most complicated and fascinating so far. Here I showcase our work and the UX work I've done for the organisation.
