  <h2>Challenges</h2>
  <h3>Knowledge Base</h3>
  <p>Primarily a design project, I researched, designed and built a custom branded WordPress site for an internal Knowledge Base. The primary goal of the app was to share all of the training documents for our internal cloud platform.</p>

  <h3>Internal API Experience</h3>
  <p>The API experience was aimed at onboarding clients and their in-house teams. While I researched, designed and built the API documentation as well, as the Client Integration Engineer I was also responsible for the whole process.</p>

  <h3>Knowledge Base</h3>

  <h3>API</h3>
  <h4>Personas</h4>
  <p>My first step in creating the API was to really understand what it is that developers need when debugging code. I interviewed the developers on my team and developers from the London Tech Community to understand what makes a good API.</p>
  <p>The personas I made also took into account that the business had plans to expand into German, where English wasn't going to be someone's first language.</p>

  <h4>Competitor Analysis</h4>
  <p>After researching well known APIs I noticed a pattern of two consistent templates. After reviewing the patterns in my personas I chose the template which placed the code and explanation side by side. My aim was to reduce the need to scroll through documentation as much as possible.</p>
