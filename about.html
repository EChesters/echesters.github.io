          <h3>What is Empower Hack</h3>

          <h3>What is HerStory?</h3>
          <p>HerStory will be a safe place where women and girls can choose to anonymously share their stories, listen and support each other with responses. We aim to be as accessible as possible, capturing stories by any means possible. </p>

          <h3>Why are we tackling issues about refugees?</h3>
          <p>Despite up to 80% of worldâ€™s refugees being women and children, the problems faced by them are never at the forefront. Female refugees are among the most vulnerable, facing sexual violence, coercion, forced and early marriage, social isolation, and a lack of access to gender-specific health care and education.</p>

        <div class="icon">
          <i class="fa fa-globe"></i>
          <h3>Cultural</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Refugees are incredibly vulnerable. Talking to these people takes time, patience and the upmost empathy. With refugees being a broad term, and coming from all around the globe we need a way of prioritising which languages are in the highest demand.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <div class="icon">
          <i class="fa fa-users"></i>
          <h3>User Experience</h3>
        </div>
        <p>The app needs to balance the feeling of the stories being public, with anonymity and security. As UX-ers we need to fully grasp the situation, overcoming the strong cultural differences between our two worlds. HerStory needs to be as accessible as possible, capturing every possible format.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <div class="icon">
          <i class="fa fa-code"></i>
          <h3>Technology</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Due to the accessibility demands HerStory will need to integrate with a lot of apps. We need to capture stories from WhatsApp, SnapChat, DropBox, and SMS just to name a few.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-xs-12 col-md-6">
        <div class="icon">

          <h3>Safety and Security</h3>
        </div>
        <p>Refugees, female refugees especially are in the most vulnerable state when we take into consideration the types of stories this platform aims to capture. Our aim is to provide inspiration, security, encouragement and support through a community. Both comments and stories will need to be moderated in some way.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="note">HerStory needs your suggestions and expertise on how to solve these issues!</p>
